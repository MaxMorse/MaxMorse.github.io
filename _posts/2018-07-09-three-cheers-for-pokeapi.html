<p>I am bouncing up and down right now because of <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">Pokéapi</a> <p>

<p>Pokéapi is a cool api with all sorts of data on Pokémon that I came across when I began researching for my <a href="https://github.com/MelodyMorse/PokemonApp">project</a>. At first I didn't think it had the data I needed on encounter rates and I began thinking about creating by own JSON file. As thereputic as simple, repetitive tasks can be, I'm glad I decided to take another look and found that Pokéapi <i>does</i> list encounter rates. (I was looking under "location" but they are listed under the similarly named "location-area") <b>Lesson: taking a little more time to prep can save hours--days even</b></P>

<p>looking forward to designing a nice, mobile friendly interface with all the time I saved! ^-^</p>
