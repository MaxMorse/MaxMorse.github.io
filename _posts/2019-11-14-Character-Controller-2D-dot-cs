I love picross but I wished the picross games I played were more flexible with how they let the player take notes. That's the idea behind this project. In addition to being a foundation for a Picross game, the project contains a simple paint program that will allow the player to make and save custom markers beyond defaults such as an X and Question mark.

* Designed game manager
* Designed UI
* Designing image editor
* Writing sprite creation and save system
