description: A tool for creating level select maps in Unity

I've been developing a tool for creating level select maps in Unity.

EasyMaps is a tool to help you create Level Select Maps in Unity. 

Here's a little bit about how it works:

The map is composed of objects called Map Nodes that have a script with class MapNode attached. Each instance of the MapNode class contains an array of four DirectionInfos, one for each cardinal direction. The user can set hasExit in any of these DirectionInfos to true in the inspector to have the Map Node attempt to find the nearest node in the corresponding direction and make a connection that the player will be able to traverse

Here is a scene with 2 mapNodes side by side.  The gizmos on the nodes have an X on each of their sides, which indicates that neither of them have any connections yet.

MapNode2 is to the East (right) of MapNode1. So in order to connect them the user only has to set hasExit on MapNode1’s Direction Infos’ Element 0 to true and MapNode1 will connect itself to MapNode2.  Alternatively the user could set hasExit on MapNode2’s Direction Infos’ Element 2 to true

This script is what allows the nodes to connect to each other: 
<pre>
  <code>
namespace EasyMaps
{
    enum Direction { East, South, West, North };

    [System.Serializable]
    public struct DirectionInfo
    {
        public bool hasExit;
        public MapNode neighbor;        
    }

    public class MapNode : MonoBehaviour
    {
        [SerializeField]
        LayerMask mapLayerMask;

        public DirectionInfo[] directionInfos = new DirectionInfo[4];
        
        private void OnValidate()
        {
            // Connect or attempt to connect to all neighbors
            foreach (Direction d in (Direction[])Enum.GetValues(typeof(Direction)))
            {
                ConnectNeighbors(d);
            }
        }

        private void ConnectNeighbors(Direction dir)
        {
            Vector2 v2 = Vector2.zero;
            //get vector2 for raycast2D
            if (dir == Direction.East) v2 = Vector2.right;
            else if (dir == Direction.South) v2 = Vector2.down;
            else if (dir == Direction.West) v2 = Vector2.left;
            else if (dir == Direction.North) v2 = Vector2.up;

            DirectionInfo info = directionInfos[(int)dir];
            if (directionInfos[(int)dir].hasExit)
            {
                //connect this to neighboring node
                directionInfos[(int)dir].neighbor = FindNeighbor(v2);
                //connect neighboring node to this
                if (directionInfos[(int)dir].neighbor != null)
                {
                    SetNeighbor(dir);
                }
                else
                {
                    Debug.LogError("inside " + gameObject.name + " " + dir.ToString()+ " neighbor not found. Setting hasExit back to false");
                    
                    directionInfos[(int)dir].hasExit = false;
                }
                
            }
        }

        private MapNode FindNeighbor(Vector2 dir)
        {    
            RaycastHit2D hit = Physics2D.Raycast(transform.position, dir, Mathf.Infinity, mapLayerMask);
            if (hit)
            {
                return hit.collider.gameObject.GetComponent<MapNode>();
            }
            else
            {
                return null;
            }
        }

        private void SetNeighbor(Direction other)
        {
            //initialize self as East.  Value will change in if/else if statements if necessary
            Direction self = Direction.East;
            
            //find this MapNode's direction in relation to Neighbor
            if (other == Direction.West) self = Direction.East;
            else if (other == Direction.East) self = Direction.West;
            else if (other == Direction.North) self = Direction.South;
            else if (other == Direction.South) self = Direction.North;
            
            //set members of neighbor's corresponding DirectionInfo such that link between this and neighbor is two way
            directionInfos[(int)other].neighbor.directionInfos[(int)self].hasExit = true;
            directionInfos[(int)other].neighbor.directionInfos[(int)self].neighbor = this;
        }
 
    }
}
