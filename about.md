I like digging through documentation and figuring out how things work.  I value teamwork and am motivated by a desire to help others.

I graduated from NHTI, Concord's Community College with an Associate of Science in Animation and Graphic Game Programming.  There I became familiar with a variety of languages and frameworks including C#, Unity and Monogame.

Since then I have been continuing to work with classmates on our capstone project from that program, on online multiplayer game, doing programming and testing in Unity.

Favorite game: Donkey Kong '94
