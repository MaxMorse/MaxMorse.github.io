<p>Hi I'm Max! I like Dungeons & Dragons and working out!</p>

<p>In school I learned to work with various programming languages and platforms, but most of my coursework had me making projects in Unity with C#.  Talk to me about GameMaker Studio and Javascript though!  Theyâ€™re my favorites!</p>

<p>I like working on a team, implementing game features, fixing bugs, refactoring code and tools development.  I suppose the throughline of all those interests is a desire to organize projects and support colleagues.</p>
