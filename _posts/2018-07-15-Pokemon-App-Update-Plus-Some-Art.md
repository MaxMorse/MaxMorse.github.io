title: Pokémon App Update Plus Some Art
---
Progress on my pokémon app: [what it looks like](https://melodymorse.github.io/PokemonApp/). [The repo](https://github.com/MelodyMorse/PokemonApp). The app doesn't work yet. I just wanted to share my progress. It's been a challenge finding the right calls to make to the api but I'm able to get a list of the sub areas in a location (i.e. the different floors in Mt. Moon). This is not implemented in the UI yet.  I've been getting back into Animal Crossing and I'm already thinking of making a similar app to aid with play sessions in that game too!

In other news, wanna see some [art](https://melodymorse.github.io/p5-gameboy-sketch/) I drew with P5.js? (also a work in progress). Here's the [repo](https://github.com/MelodyMorse/p5-gameboy-sketch) if you want to see my process.  Drawing with P5 is a lot easier than vanilla javascript! I'm a stickler for getting the proportions right though so this is taking some time. ^-^; I'd like to draw other Nintendo handhelds and consoles in the future! Ah I suppose this water spirit's always looking forward
