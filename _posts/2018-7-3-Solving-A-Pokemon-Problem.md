title: Solving a Pokemon Problem
---

Whenever I play a Pokemon game I find it frustrating that there’s almost never any in game indication of where and how to catch each Pokemon.  For this reason I often have [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page) or [Serebii](https://www.serebii.net/index2.shtml) open while I am playing, but it can be a hassle to navigate these sites when I just want to have a relaxing time filling the pokedex. With my [Pokemon app project](https://github.com/MelodyMorse/PokemonApp) I intend to facilitate that relaxing experience with a stress free interface and display of the key information I always wish I had on hand while playing Pokemon. Though I’m designing this app with my specific playstyle in mind--with a focus on filling the Pokedex rather than battling--I hope that others will find it useful.
